### - Design  

- Colour scheme
    - The 3 main colours used are black, white and gold. 
- Typography
    - The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto is used frequently in programming, and is both attractive and appropriate.
 - Imagery
    - The imagery is important. Each page has a large background image which are all recoloured to RGB(0, 0, 0). They are designed to give the website an aesthetic, bold and proffesional look without distracting the user from the content of the site.
